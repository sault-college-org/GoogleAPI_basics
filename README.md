## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be straightforward and easy to comprehend, making it an ideal starting point for individuals new to web development.

## Boilerplate Features:

- It includes essential files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the necessary configurations to set up a Google Maps project quickly.

## Code Organization:

- The codebase is organized to showcase best practices and a clear project structure, making it easy for developers to understand and extend the functionality.

## Usage Guidelines:

- The repository typically includes documentation or a README file with instructions on how to use the boilerplate, integrate the Google Maps API, and customize the map according to specific project requirements.

## Key Components:

- Important components like API key handling, map initialization, markers, and event handling may be included to demonstrate common use cases.

- **index.html:** The main HTML file representing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** A simple stylesheet for basic styling.
- **scripts folder:** Contains JavaScript files illustrating basic concepts. Each file focuses on a specific part of the project to aid in learning.
- **Restaurants README:**  A markup file where students will exercise their abilities to write good documentation for their work done.
- **assets folder:** Contains parts requested in Lab 4 from Google "MY MAPS"


## Getting Started

Open index.html in your preferred web browser to see the basic web page.
Explore the JavaScript files in the src folder to understand and experiment with different concepts.

JavaScript Topics Covered
The JavaScript files in the src folder cover various fundamental topics:

Variables: variables.js introduces the concept of variables.
Functions: functions.js demonstrates creating and using functions.
DOM Manipulation: dom.js showcases simple DOM manipulation.
Imports: imports.js illustrates how to use imports in JavaScript files.

## Usage
Feel free to use this repository as a learning resource. Experiment with the code, modify it, and see how changes affect the web page. This repository is intentionally kept simple to provide a clear understanding of the basics.

## Credits
This project is inspired by [Anapdh](https://github.com/anapdh) and her [anapdh/restaurant-page](https://github.com/anapdh/restaurant-page) which is a more comprehensive Node.js project. The simplified version here is intended for educational purposes.
